sfig
====

SVG/Javascript-based library for creating presentations/figures.

sfig works by itself, but you can readily incorporate third-party libraries.
For example, sfig uses MathJax to render math.  You can download some of these
packages:

    ./download-packages

To get an overview of the functionality, point your web browser to:

    examples/tutorial.html

If you want to create a presentation, start with:

    examples/simple-presentation.html

In any sfig presentation, you can press '?' for help.
